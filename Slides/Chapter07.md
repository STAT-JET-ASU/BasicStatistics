Randomness!
========================================================

*  **Randomness** is a lack of pattern or exact predictability. A random sequence of outcomes or events has no order and does not follow any identifiable pattern or combination. 

*  Individual random events are by definition unpredictable, but the relative frequency of different outcomes over a very large number of events (often called "trials") is predictable. 

*  Example: if you roll two six-sided dice and add the values, the result of one roll is unpredictable, but in the long run a sum of seven will occur twice as often as a sum of four. 

*  Randomness reflects our **uncertainty** about an outcome, not haphazardness in the process that produces it.



Random Circumstance
========================================================

A **random circumstance** is a scenario in which the exact outcome is unpredictable. There are two kinds of random circumstances we can think about.

*  The outcome is not determined until we observe it. 

Example: whether the coin flip at the start of a football game turn out to be heads or tails.

*  The outcome has been determined, but our knowledge of the outcome is uncertain. 

Example: Whether or not someone has a BRCA or PALB2 gene mutation. They have it or they do not, but we do not know until we do a test.



What are the Chances?
========================================================

While we cannot predict exactly what will happen for any given random circumstance, we can often determine a set of possible outcomes and attach a **probability** to each outcome.

Sometimes, the probabilities of the outcomes for a given random circumstance depend on another random circumstance. 

Example: The chance of being injured in a car accident depends on whether or not the person is wearing a seatbelt.

We also refer to random circumstances as **random variables** and use them to mathematically model the world. Something that is not random is **deterministic**.



Probability Interpretations
========================================================

For situations that we can imagine repeating many times, the probability of an outcome is the fraction of the time it would happen in the long run. We express probabilities as fractions, proportions, or percentages.

*  **relative frequency probabilities** rely on determining how often each outcome occurs relative to the others, based on logical assumptions and theory <u>or</u> on direct observation of events (empirical or experimental probability) 

*  **personal probabilities** (or **subjective probabilities**) rely on an individual's judgment and experience, often when there is not enough data or a circumstance is not repeatable



Genders of Students
========================================================

This **frequency table** summarizes self-identified genders for students in several of Dr. Thomley's previous STT1810 classes. Note that students were provided with non-binary options, but no students selected them. The relative frequencies estimate probability that a randomly selected student is male or female.

The relative frequencies estimate probability that a randomly selected student is a particular major.



Defining Events 
========================================================

*  A **simple event** is a unique possible outcome of a random circumstance.
*  The **sample space** of a random circumstance is the set of all simple events.
*  A **compound event** is an event that includes two or more simple events.
*  An **event** is a collection of one or more simple events in the sample space.

Later we will talk about **complementary**, **mutally exclusive**, and **independent/dependent** events.



Probability Rules 
========================================================

For a given random circumstance...

*  The probability of any possible outcome is between 0 and 1
*  The sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes is 1

Even personal probabilities must be **coherent probabilities**: the values have to be between 0 and 1 and they cannot contradict one another. If you think you have a 20% chance of getting a job, then you should think you have an 80% chance of not getting it. 

Question: What do extreme probability values 0 and 1 indicate?



Example: Simple Event 
========================================================

The random circumstance is the major of a randomly selected STT1810 student. The tables on on the previous slides provided relative frequency probability estimates. 

sample space = {Communication Disorders, Criminal Justice, HLES, Nursing, Political Science, Other}



A = the simple event that a student is a political science major

P(A) = 135 / 486 = 0.2778 = 27.78%

P(A) is read as "the probability of event A" or "probability of A".



Example: Compound Event 
========================================================



B = a randomly selected student is from a major in the Dept. of Government and Justice Studies

This compound event includes the two simple events "political science" and "criminal justice".

P(B) = (135 + 190) / 486 = 0.6687 = 66.87%

Why can we just add these frequencies? We will come back to that, but an important point is that each student has only one major included in the dataset.



Rule 1: Complement Rule
========================================================

What is the probability that an event does _not_ occur?

One event is the **complement** of another if they do not contain any of the same simple events and together they contain all the simple events in the sample space. In other words, they do not overlap and together they cover the whole sample space.

B = a student is from Government and Justice Studies

B<sup>c</sup> = a student is _not_ from Government and Justice Studies

P(B) + P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 1 &rarr; P(B<sup>c</sup>) = 1 - P(B) &rarr; 1 - 0.6687 = 0.3313



Mutually Exclusive
========================================================

Two events are **mutually exclusive** (also called **disjoint**) if they do not contain any of the same simple events. By definition, if events are complements they are also mutually exclusive, but not all mutually exclusive events are complementary.

A = student is a political science major

C = student is from the Beaver College of Health Sciences

One student cannot belong to both A and C, but together these two events do not include all possible majors (e.g., Other).

Question: Can a student be both Male and a Nursing major?



Independent
========================================================

Two events are **independent** if knowing that one will occur (or has occurred) does not affect the probability that the other will occur. Otherwise the events are **dependent**.

Being dependent does not mean one event causes the other. It just means they are related in some way.

Question: Are Major and Gender independent of one another?

We can answer this question by looking at another kind of data table that summarizes both random variables together.



Let's Investigate!
========================================================

This **contingency table** shows students by major and gender.

```

Question: Can a student be both Male and a Nursing major (are the two events mutually exclusive)?

Question: Are Major and Gender independent of one another?



Rule 2: Addition Rule
========================================================

What is the probability that either one or both of two particular events happen? In other words, for a randomly chosen case, only A _or_ B has to be true, but both might be true in some cases.

*  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

*  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) . . . if A and B are mutually exclusive

If A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A and B) = 0 &rarr; impossible!

We already saw that we could add probabilities when we found P(B) for students from Government and Justice Studies.

```

Question: What is the chance that a randomly selected STT1810 student is Male <u>or</u> a Nursing major (or both)?

P(Male **or** Nursing) = P(Male) + P(Nursing) - P(Male and Nursing)



Rule 3: Multiplication Rule
========================================================

What is the probabilty that two events happen together (or in sequence)?

*  P(A and B) = P(A)P(B|A) = P(B)P(A|B)

*  P(A and B) = P(A)P(B) ... if A and B are independent

*  We can extend the rule for multiple independent events

P(A|B) is read as "the conditional probability of event A given event B" or "probability of A given B".



Conditional Probability
========================================================

Sometimes, the probabilities of the outcomes for a given random circumstance depend on another random circumstance. 

The **conditional probability** of event B, given event A, is the long run relative frequency with which B occurs when A has occurred or will occur. As noted earlier, we write this as P(B|A). 

Reminder: Just because events A and B depend on one another does not necessarily mean one event causes the other. Making a determination of cause and effect relies on other methods, such as performing a controlled experiment.



Rule 4: Conditional Probability
========================================================

This rule is an algebraic restatement of Rule 3; sometimes useful to view it this way, depending on what probabilities we know in a given scenario. 

P(B|A) = P(A and B) / P(A)

Since the labels given to events A and B are essentially arbitrary, we can write the expression either way.

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

We calculated the probability of a student's gender conditional on major earlier, but let's revisit it...



Let's Investigate!
========================================================

  Criminal Justice            55  135 190
  HLES                        20   17  37

  Political Science           59   76 135
  Sum                        240  246 486
```

Question: What is the chance that a randomly selected STT1810 student is both Male <u>and</u> a Nursing major?

* P(Male **and** Nursing) = P(Male)P(Nursing|Male)
* P(Male **and** Nursing) = P(Nursing)P(Male|Nursing)



Independent Events?
========================================================

How do we know if events A and B are independent?

* The physical situation makes it clear that knowledge of event A does not change the probability that event B will occur.

* If the conditional probability P(A|B) equals the unconditional probability P(A) then knowledge of B does not matter and the events A and B are independent.

* By the same reasoning as above, if P(B|A) = P(B), then A and B are independent.

* A and B are independent if and only if P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)



Sampling
========================================================

We must consider method of sampling in random circumstances, since that impacts whether or not some events are independent.

* sampling **with replacement** means that sampled individuals are returned to the eligible pool for each selection.

* sampling **without replacement** means sampled individuals are not eligible for subsequent selection.

In a large population, probability differences are often negligible.

Question: When would we need to use conditional probabilities for our calculations?



Let's Investigate!
========================================================

A preset lock combination is made up of three digits 0 through 9. Assuming the digits are randomly chosen, what is the probability that the combination is 1-2-3? 

With replacement, P(1 and 2 and 3) =

Without replacement, P(1 and 2 and 3) = 



Confusion of the Inverse
========================================================

For dependent events A and B, P(A|B) is not the same as P(B|A). People often make the mistake of assuming they are, and this is known as **confusion of the inverse**.

Example: What is the probability that someone tests positive for a disease, given that we know they have the disease? Then what about the inverse, the probability that someone has the disease, given a positive test? Mosts tests ar not 100% accurate.

**sensitivity** is the probability of getting a positive test outcome, given that the person has the disease

**specificity** is the probability of getting a negative test outcome, given that the person does not have the disease



Let's Investigate!
========================================================

In 2010, about it was estimated that ~20,000 of the 1.57 million inmates incarcerated in state and federal prisons in the United States were HIV+. Most of them acquired HIV prior to prison.

A particular rapid oral HIV test has the following properties.

* sensitivity = 98.4%
* specificity = 99.6%

Suppose a new federal law mandates that we test the entire prison population for HIV. What is the chance that a prisoner with a positive test is actually HIV+?



Tables and Trees
========================================================

Contingency tables and tree diagrams are two tools we can use to visualize and solve probability problems. We already have been using data tables, but we can create hypothetical tables.

* How can we investigate our problem with a **hypothetical 100,000** table?

* How can we investigate our problem with a **tree diagram**?

We could also use **Bayes Rule** to tackle this problem, but we will focus on the other two methods in this class. 



The Birthday Problem
========================================================

What is the probability that at least two people in a group share a birthday?

How many people do we need to have so that the probability is at least 50%?

We can explore this question using observation, simulation, and mathematical logic.
